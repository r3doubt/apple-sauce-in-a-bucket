# apple-sauce-in-a-bucket
This script by r3doubt hardApple v0.1
Test before you use and modify as needed
Implements light version of NIST SP-800-179 and NCSC EUD for 10.12 10.13 configs
Heavy version to follow later, consider looking at NCSC provisioning script for 10.12 in meantime
Run using "sudo", will prompt if you don't
Run the quickaudit script first to check SIP status and get info on stuff you might want to turn off
yeah, I know I should move all the default writes to arrays and loops, feel free to contribute
